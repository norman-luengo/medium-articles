    "# How Python works behind the scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know python is an interpreted programming language, that means that a lot of things are happening behind the scenes to make our time with python easier and more friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever asked yourself how much resources are you using to run your python code? Is it using all your powerful cpu cores and all your memory ram?\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the answer to that is **no**, you are not using all the power your machine has if you are not into multiprocessing. Python only uses one process by default which is using only one core of your cpu, that means that even your machine has 10 cores your python script is only using 1, so actually you are missing a lot of the power your machine is capable of.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Blocking vs. Non-Blocking**: A blocking function stops the execution of the entire program until it has completed, while a non-blocking function allows other tasks to be performed during its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coroutines**: A coroutine is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed at specific points. Coroutines are used in asyncio to allow the program to switch between tasks as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop**: An event loop is a mechanism that allows the program to switch between tasks. In asyncio, the event loop is responsible for scheduling and executing coroutines."

    "## When to Use Each Function\n",
    "When deciding whether to use time.sleep() or asyncio.sleep, it is important to consider the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking vs. Non-Blocking**: If you need to pause the execution of the entire program, use time.sleep(). If you need to allow other tasks to be performed during the waiting period, use asyncio.sleep.\n",

    "**Performance**: asyncio.sleep is generally more performant than time.sleep() because it allows the program to switch between tasks as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**: asyncio can be more complex to use than standard functions because it requires the use of coroutines and an event loop. If you do not need the benefits of asyncio, it may be simpler to use standard functions."
